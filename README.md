# Netlify CMS Docs Kit: Hugo with Learn Theme

A starter kit for documentation using Hugo and Netlify CMS, with the Learn theme.

Though this kit does not require netlify hosting, it's an easy way to get it started or to try it out.

1. Use the Deploy to Netlify to create your version of the site:
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/verythorough/docs-kit-hugo-learn)

2. Using GitHub's editor or your farvorite text editor, edit line 3 in the file at `/static/admin/config.yml`, completing the `repo` field with your GitHub username and repo name.

3. Go to the [Netlify CMS docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/test-drive/) and follow the steps to authenticate with GitHub and access the CMS.
